# SELFTEST-01 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented and updated the AI-powered self-test system for healthcare patients with all requested modifications.

## Changes Made (May 25, 2025)

### 1. Patient Dashboard Button Update ✅
**File**: `src/healthcare/templates/patient/dashboard.html`
**Change**: Updated the "Health Self-Test" button to point directly to `/selftest/` instead of the dashboard
```html
<!-- Before -->
<a href="{% url 'selftest:dashboard' %}" class="btn btn-outline-patient w-100 p-3">

<!-- After -->
<a href="/selftest/" class="btn btn-outline-patient w-100 p-3">
```

### 2. Severity System Update (10-stage → 4-stage) ✅

#### Forms Update
**File**: `src/healthcare/selftest/forms.py`
- Updated `SymptomReportForm.SEVERITY_CHOICES` from 10 levels to 4 levels
- Changed help text from "1-10" to "1-4"
- Updated QuickTestForm severity choices to range 1-5 instead of 1-11

#### Models Update
**File**: `src/healthcare/selftest/models.py`
- Updated `SymptomReport.SEVERITY_CHOICES` to 4 levels:
  - 1: Mild
  - 2: Moderate  
  - 3: Severe
  - 4: Very Severe

#### Template Updates
**File**: `src/healthcare/templates/selftest/quick_test.html`
- Updated severity buttons from 10 to 4 levels
- Changed severity display from "1-10" to "1-4"
- Updated JavaScript severity descriptions
- Fixed selected symptoms display to show "/4" instead of "/10"

#### AI Engine Updates
**File**: `src/healthcare/selftest/ai_engine.py`
- Updated severity bonus calculation for 4-point scale
- Adjusted risk level determination for new severity range
- Modified high severity detection (≥4 for urgent, ≥3 for high risk)

### 3. Database Schema Fix ✅
**File**: `src/healthcare/selftest/migrations/0002_fix_patient_field.py`
- Created migration to fix `patient_id` column issue
- Removed old `user` field and added proper `patient` field
- Added all missing fields for enhanced SelfTest model
- Created Symptom and SymptomReport models
- Established proper relationships between models

### 4. Automation Testing ✅
**File**: `src/healthcare/selftest/tests.py`
- Created comprehensive test suite with 5 test classes
- Added tests for models, AI engine, views, integration, and forms
- Included preknown symptom testing scenarios:
  - Common cold symptoms
  - Influenza symptoms  
  - Severe symptoms requiring urgent care
- Verified correct disease predictions and risk levels

**File**: `src/healthcare/test_selftest_automation.py`
- Created standalone automation test script
- Tests AI engine with predefined symptom sets
- Verifies web interface functionality
- Tests complete workflow from symptom selection to results
- Validates severity level restrictions

**File**: `src/healthcare/quick_test_verification.py`
- Simple verification script for key functionality
- Tests severity levels, AI engine, and patient button URL
- Provides quick validation of all changes

## Test Scenarios Implemented

### Preknown Symptom Tests
1. **Common Cold**: Runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, cough
   - Expected: Low-Medium risk, respiratory illness predictions
   
2. **Influenza**: Fever, muscle aches, fatigue, headache  
   - Expected: Medium-High risk, flu/viral infection predictions
   
3. **Severe Symptoms**: Chest pain, difficulty breathing
   - Expected: High-Urgent risk, cardiovascular/respiratory emergency

### Severity Level Validation
- Verified forms only accept 1-4 severity levels
- Confirmed descriptive labels are correct
- Tested AI engine properly handles 4-point scale

## Files Modified

### Core Application Files
- `src/healthcare/selftest/models.py` - Updated severity choices
- `src/healthcare/selftest/forms.py` - 4-stage severity system
- `src/healthcare/selftest/ai_engine.py` - Adjusted for new severity scale
- `src/healthcare/selftest/views.py` - No changes needed (already compatible)

### Templates
- `src/healthcare/templates/patient/dashboard.html` - Button URL update
- `src/healthcare/templates/selftest/quick_test.html` - Severity UI updates

### Database
- `src/healthcare/selftest/migrations/0002_fix_patient_field.py` - Schema fix

### Testing
- `src/healthcare/selftest/tests.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `src/healthcare/test_selftest_automation.py` - Automation testing
- `src/healthcare/quick_test_verification.py` - Quick verification

### Documentation
- `docs/status.md` - Updated project status
- `src/healthcare/SELFTEST_01_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Verification Steps

1. **Patient Dashboard**: Button now points to `/selftest/` ✅
2. **Severity Selection**: Only 4 levels available (1-4) ✅  
3. **Database Operations**: No more `patient_id` column errors ✅
4. **AI Predictions**: Correct disease predictions for known symptoms ✅
5. **Risk Assessment**: Proper risk levels based on 4-point severity ✅

## System Status

### All Requirements Met ✅
- ✅ Patient health self-test button points to `/selftest/`
- ✅ Severity system limited to 4 stages instead of 10
- ✅ Database schema fixed (no more `patient_id` errors)
- ✅ Automation tests with preknown symptoms implemented
- ✅ Correct disease predictions verified

### Ready for Production ✅
- All migrations applied successfully
- Comprehensive testing completed
- User interface updated and functional
- AI engine calibrated for new severity scale
- Error handling improved

## Next Steps
The SELFTEST-01 implementation is now complete and fully functional. The system can:
1. Accept patient symptom input with 4-stage severity
2. Provide accurate AI-powered disease predictions
3. Display appropriate risk levels and recommendations
4. Save test results without database errors
5. Integrate seamlessly with patient dashboard

All requested changes have been implemented and tested successfully.
